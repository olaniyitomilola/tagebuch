# tagebuch
tagebuch means diary in english. This is an app I'm building for my friend, to help her record the 10 german word she learns per day
It will also display a reward system that we've decided to implement. At the beginning of each session, which is supposed to last 10 days, she will send N10,000 to me. For each day she does the task N1,000 goes to her account and the accumulation of all these will be sent back to her at the end of each session.
On ocassions when she gets a 10/10, the app will test her and choose 20 random questions from the entries supply, if she gets 70%, 50% will be added to her reward.
